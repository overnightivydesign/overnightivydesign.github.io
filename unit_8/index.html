					<h3>Oh, hello!</h3>
						<p>Overnight Ivy Design's creator, Amanda Ivy, has no design experience whatsoever other than the relentless and enthusiastic pursuit of endlessly redesigning the apartment she shares with her skeptical boyfriend and their two dogs. <!-- But before you brush off her credibility entirely, please note that her middle name really is Ivy. So there's that. --></p>

					<h3>
						Welcome to Overnight Ivy. Welcome Home.
					</h3>
					<p>Great home design doesn't have to be expensive, time-consuming, or frustrating. Making small changes - to a room, to an object, to a space - can make a big, beautiful difference. Using materials you already have, on your own time, you can transform your space into a home you'll love.</p>


					<p>"The beautiful must ever rest in the arms of the sublime. The gentle needs the strong to sustain it, as much as the rock-flowers need rocks to grow on, or the ivy the rugged wall which it embraces." -Harriet Beecher Stowe </p>
